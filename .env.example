# Copy this file to `.env` and add your GitHub API key if you have one.
# For Vite, env vars available to client must be prefixed with VITE_.
# Example:
# VITE_APP_GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_token_here

# If you don't have an API key the app will still work for public endpoints,
# but you may hit rate limits if you make many unauthenticated requests.
